\section{Introduction}
In this section, we introduce the fundamental concepts and set the stage for our research. We will also present some important equations, such as Maxwell's equations.

Maxwell's equations describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields:
\begin{align}
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} \\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \\
    \nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \\
    \nabla \times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
\end{align}

\subsection{Schrodinger Equation}
The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a quantum system is given by:

\subsection{Navier-Stokes Equations}
The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of incompressible fluid flow:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u} &= -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu\nabla^2\mathbf{u} \\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &= 0
\end{align}
